# Organisational ways of working 

This organisation is managed by a small number of 'owners'.  These owners have delegated as much flexibility as possible to 'team maintainers' as possible as it is recognised that central management won't be able to keep up with the team github usage.  However, there are a few ways of working which are still managed by the organisation owners which are outlined below. 

### Organisation Settings

- Two Factor Authorisation must be switched on for all members. 
- Private repository forking is switched off - only public ones can be forked.
- Private IO pages are switched off - only public ones can be created.
- New teams need to be setup by the owners
- Only owners can delete or transfer a repository currently
- Third-party application access requests go to the owners to approve
- Github Apps need to be approved by the owners

### Not Currently Implemented but being considered

- Base Settings changed to none with all members included in everyone team to enable optional org wide sharing of private repos 
- Enterprise Single Sign On
- Automated setup of Repos including secret scanning etc...
- Organisational accoutns for Owners and Team Maintainers but Personal for Members.
- Defined responsible owners for paid aspects of GitHub experience (e.g. Actions)
- Templates for new users, teams, third-party access requests, github apps to go through service now.
- Working group structure and process for sign-off on organisational changes
