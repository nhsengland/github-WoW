# Organisational ways of working 

This organisation is managed by a small number of 'owners'.  These owners have delegated as much flexibility as possible to 'team maintainers' as possible as it is recognised that central management won't be able to keep up with the team github usage.  However, there are a few ways of working which are still managed by the organisation owners which are outlines below. 

### Organisation Settings

- Two Factor Authorisation must be switched on for all members. 
- Private repository forking is switched off - onlu public ones can be forked.
- Private IO pages are switched off - only public ones can be created.
- New teams need to be setup by the owners
- Only owners can delete or transfer a repository currently
- Third-party application access requests go to the owners to approve
- Github Apps need to be approved by the owners
