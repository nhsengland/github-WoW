# Use of Teams in Github

In this Github Organisation we have decided to use Teams to manage our repositories.  Every repo should be aligned to a team and every member should be in at least one team.   Each team will be set to have one or two 'Team Maintainers' who manage access and repo management for that team.  These maintainers will need to keep an eye on team access and ensure that members who have left or moved to another team are removed.  This way of working should ensure the required felxibility for github usage without putting a burden on the Github Owners. 

Each team is enocuraged to define and use templates for their repos similar to [this one](https://github.com/nhsengland/analyticsunit-template).  The team should also consider their branching strategy.  This is left up to the team to decide based on their ways of working but for small teams Github Flow is recommended.  [Branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) are also reocmmended but left to the team to administer.

Finally, the team maintainer is also responsible for keeping their team repositories clean through archiving and delteing when appropraite.
